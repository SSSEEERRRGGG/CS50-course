0.  It`s the longest word in English, what mean a lung disease caused by the inhalation of silica dust.
1.  It returns resource usage measures for the calling process itself, the children of the calling process, or the calling thread (Example: RUSAGE_SEF).
2.  There are 16 members:2 structs and 16 long types.
3.  Passing in values involves copying the two 16 member struts which would take some time and memory. getrusage prototype expects a pointer, and this is more efficient than passing by value.
    If a rusage struct has an undefined value it is autonatically set to zero, so this negates any dereferencing crashes or extra checks.
4.  The for loop spell checks each word by each character (until it points at an end of file character). It appends chracters to the word array with permanent ignoring
    numbers and strings that have more than the given, fixed length (it`s require current character as alphabetical or an apostrophe). Then, once it reaches the end of the string, 
    the function prepares for a new word. Once a whole valid word is found, the current word in the word array is terminated, the counter is updated, and then the spelling is checked.
    If the word is misspelled, the function prints that word and once again prepares for the next word.
5.  fgetc checks the character is a valid letter and fscanf does not check each character and might return a string with some invalid characters (fine to use 
    then every words finishing by a space or a line return). fgetc reads the file character by character, discriminating vs anything that isn't alphabetical or an apostrophe proceeded by a character.
6.  The const type ensures that the initial value of the parameter can`t be modified.
